# Credit-Card-Customer-Transaction-Report
Credit Card Financial Weekly Dashboard
📌 Project Overview
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends. This project enables stakeholders to monitor business operations effectively and identify growth opportunities in the credit card market.

🎯 Business Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze customer transaction data to answer critical business questions:

How is revenue performing week-over-week?

Which customer demographics contribute the most to revenue?

What are the spending patterns across different card categories and expenditure types?

How can we mitigate credit risk (delinquency rates)?

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI / Tableau: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

SQL: For data extraction, cleaning, and processing.

Excel/CSV: Raw data source handling.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for calculating measures like Weekly Revenue, YoY Growth, and Running Totals.

📊 Dashboard Structure
The report is divided into two main dashboards:

1. Credit Card Customer Report
This view provides a deep dive into the customer base, segmenting metrics by demographics.

Key Metrics: Total Revenue, Total Interest, Total Income, Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS).

Visualizations:

Revenue by Age Group, Marital Status, and Income Group.

Revenue vs. Gender (Line Chart).

Top 5 States by contribution (TX, NY, CA, FL, NJ).

Customer Job analysis (Blue-collar, White-collar, Self-employed, etc.).

2. Credit Card Transaction Report
This view focuses on financial performance and transaction behaviors.

Key Metrics: Transaction Count, Transaction Amount, Annual Fees.

Visualizations:

📉 Recommendations
Based on the data analysis, the following actions are recommended:

Targeted Marketing: Focus marketing campaigns in TX, NY, and CA as they yield the highest return.

Product Focus: Since "Bills" and "Entertainment" are the highest expenditure types, introduce rewards or cash-back offers in these categories to drive usage.

Risk Management: Investigate the 6.06% delinquency rate and implement stricter credit checks for the demographic segments with the highest default probability.

Digital Adoption: With "Swipe" usage still high (35M), encourage "Online" and "Chip" usage through security awareness campaigns.
